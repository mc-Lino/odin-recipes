<!-- In this project im gonna make an html for a website or like my website
its not gonna be a good looking one but just plain html because im just making the structure for the website in this project
i will be using anything that i know about html, which some of them is, <p> for making paragraph, <h1> for making a headings, <head> for making the head of the website, and <body> to make the body of the website and then something like <img> for images.
i hope this project can be done without much trouble and finished as soon as possible so i can advance to next project -->
